              	<h4>Preparing for your code contribution</h4>
              </header>
              	<p>While we appreciate spontaneous code contributions, it's a good practice to talk to us before doing something bigger than a few small bug fixes, specially if it's about a new feature. The reason is simple: we'd like to show you how we think might be the best approach to tackle the problem. Also, we might already have started some coding around a similar feature, or we might have this feature in the roadmap already, with our ideas. Combining our ideas with your ideas is certainly the ideal scenario!</p><br>

              	<h4>Non-code contribution</h4>
              </header>
              	<p>We also welcome non-code contributions, such as design ideas, feature requests, documentation writing/review and so on. We are specially thankful for feedback on real usage of <span class="logo">Qaclana</span>: if you have an instance running somewhere, let us know. We promise not to tell anyone if you don't want us to, but we'd really benefit from having some info from you, specially regarding the performance. Contact us on our chat server and we'll follow up with you privately.</p>
